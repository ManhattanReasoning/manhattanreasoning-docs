# Architecture

The orchestrator manages a fixed pool of **10 FPGA nodes** (`fpga_id` `0`–`9`).
Every interaction flows through three core concepts: the **FPGA state machine**,
**sessions**, and **jobs**.

## FPGA state machine

Each FPGA is always in exactly one state. Operations are only valid from
certain states, which keeps two users from clobbering the same board.

```mermaid

    [*] --> idle
    idle --> queued: submit
    queued --> building: worker picks up
    queued --> idle: cancel
    building --> programming: build ok
    building --> idle: build failed
    programming --> reserved: programmed
    programming --> error: program failed
    reserved --> reserved: run
    reserved --> idle: reset / release
    reserved --> error
    error --> idle: reset
```

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `idle` | Free. Accepts a new `submit`. |
| `queued` | A build-and-program job is waiting for a worker. |
| `building` | The design is compiling in the build sandbox. |
| `programming` | The bitstream is being flashed onto the board. |
| `reserved` | Programmed and held for the submitter. Accepts `run` transactions. |
| `error` | A program/run step failed. Must be `reset` back to `idle`. |

## Sessions

When a design is successfully programmed, the FPGA becomes `reserved` and a
**session** is created for the submitter. The session ties a board to its owner
and carries a TTL (`expires_at`). While reserved, only the session holder may
run transactions or reset the board.

Releasing a session (`POST /fpga/{id}/session/release`) enqueues a reset job
that returns the FPGA to `idle` once it completes.

## Jobs

All work is asynchronous. An endpoint that changes hardware state returns
**`202 Accepted`** with a `job_id`; you poll the job to follow its progress.

There are three job **types**:

| Type | Triggered by | Does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `build_and_program` | `POST /fpga/{id}/submit` | Compiles the HDL and flashes the bitstream. |
| `run` | `POST /fpga/{id}/run` | Executes a Wishbone read/write transaction. |
| `reset` | `reset` / `session/release` | Reflashes the base LiteX SoC, returns to idle. |

And five job **statuses**: `queued` → `running` → `complete`, or `failed`, or
`cancelled` (only a `queued` job can be cancelled).

Poll a job with [`GET /fpga/{id}/jobs/{job_id}`](../api/rest.md#jobs); fetch its
build log at `/logs` and, for `run` jobs, its data at `/result`.

## Putting it together

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant O as Orchestrator
    participant W as Worker / FPGA
    C->>O: POST /fpga/3/submit (design.py)
    O-->>C: 202 { job_id, status: queued }
    O->>W: build_and_program
    W-->>O: programmed → reserved
    C->>O: GET /fpga/3/jobs/{job_id} (poll)
    O-->>C: { status: complete }
    C->>O: POST /fpga/3/run { op, address, data }
    O-->>C: 202 { job_id }
    C->>O: GET /fpga/3/jobs/{job_id}/result
    O-->>C: { ok: true, data: [...] }
    C->>O: POST /fpga/3/session/release
```
